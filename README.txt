BUGS
- adds when on an individual work page without user action
- broken on bookmarks page (again... *sigh*)

TODO
- bugsquashin'
- Get a nice icon
- Credits page/area
- Read only mode for browsing in private mode

WISHLIST (not for this release)
- bookmark by individual line (useful for works that are 50,000+ words in a single chapter)
- tests, HAHAHAHA. THESE ARE IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO AREN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
- Add support for tumblr (I shudder to think how much work...)
- Localization
- Delete works from database via settings page
